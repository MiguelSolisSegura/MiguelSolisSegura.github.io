## Introduction
This project focuses on using the MoveIt2 framework with the UR3e robotic arm to execute a basic Pick & Place task. The task involves automating the process of picking up an object from one location on a table and placing it in another, a fundamental yet pivotal operation in robotics aimed at enhancing efficiency in industrial applications.

## Objectives
- Configure and utilize the MoveIt2 package for the UR3e robotic arm.
- Develop a C++ program using the Move Group Interface API for automated sequence execution.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** C++
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** ROS 2, MoveIt2
- **Robotics Hardware:** UR3e Robotic Arm
- **Simulation Tools:** Gazebo, RViz
- **Version Control:** Git

## Source Code
- [GitHub Manipulation Project Repository](https://github.com/MiguelSolisSegura/manipulation_project)

## Process and Development
The project involves several critical phases, each designed to ensure the system's functionality both in simulation and on the actual hardware.

### MoveIt2 Configuration
**Setup:** Configured MoveIt2 for the UR3e arm using a specific URDF file, prepared both simulation and real robot environments.

**Implementation:** Utilized the Move Group Interface in C++ to control the robotic arm's trajectory in picking and placing tasks.

### Simulation and Real Robot Testing
**Simulation Testing:** Conducted initial tests in a simulated environment using Gazebo and RViz to validate the setup and execution of the robotic movements.

**Real Robot Testing:** Applied the developed program in a real-world setting with the UR3e arm to test and refine the pick and place operations. Adjustments were made based on the robotâ€™s performance to ensure precise and reliable task execution.
