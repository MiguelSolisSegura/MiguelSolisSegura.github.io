## Introduction
This project stands as a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired in the ROS2 Basics course, applied to both a simulated and a real-world scenario using the Turtlebot3 robot. It highlights the transition from simulation to real-world application, involving the development of ROS2 services and actions to control the robot's navigation in a given environment. The project underscores the capability to operate the robot remotely, executing tasks in Barcelona, Spain, from a simulation environment, thereby showcasing the power of ROS2 in robotics development.

## Objectives
- To implement ROS2 services that analyze laser sensor data to guide robot movement decisions.
- To create ROS2 actions for sending the robot to specific goal positions.
- To demonstrate seamless transition from simulated to real-world robot control.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** C++
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** ROS2 actions & services, Gazebo for simulation
- **Hardware:** Turtlebot3 Robot
- **Version Control:** Git

## Source Code
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MiguelSolisSegura/citylab_project)

## Process and Development
The project's execution was divided into two primary tasks, each focusing on different aspects of robot control through ROS2.

### Task 1: Services for Robot Navigation
**Simulation Setup:** Commenced with launching the Turtlebot3 robot simulation in Gazebo, preparing the ground for developing navigation services.

**Service Development:** Created a ROS2 service server in C++ (`direction_service.cpp`) that receives laser data from the Turtlebot3 and analyzes it to determine the safest direction for the robot to move, enhancing its obstacle avoidance capabilities.

**Integration with Patrol Behavior:** Modified the existing patrol behavior script (`patrol_with_service.cpp`) to include calls to the newly developed ROS2 service, allowing for dynamic obstacle avoidance based on real-time sensor data. After successfully testing the navigation node in simulation, it was deployed to the real robot.

### Task 2: Actions for Position Goals
**Action Server Creation:** Developed an action server (`go_to_pose_action.cpp`) that accepts goal positions and navigates the Turtlebot3 to these locations using odometry and velocity commands, showcasing advanced robot control techniques.

**Real-world Deployment:** After rigorous testing in the simulation, the project was deployed to control a real Turtlebot3 robot. This involved remote connection and operation, demonstrating the practical application of ROS2 actions and services beyond a simulated environment.

## Results
The project successfully demonstrated the application of ROS2 services and actions in controlling the Turtlebot3 robot, both in simulation and in a real-world environment. It highlighted the capability of ROS2 to facilitate complex robotics operations, including navigation and obstacle avoidance, in diverse environments.

## Key Insights
- Having a proper understanding of linear algebra proves to be crucial when dealing with robot orientation.
- It is necessary to account for topic rate when deploying an algorithm to real robots.
