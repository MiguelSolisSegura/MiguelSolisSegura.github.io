## Introduction
This project focuses on adapting a robotic model to utilize ROS2 control within the Gazebo simulation environment, enhancing both realism and functionality. The objective was to migrate the URDF descriptions to ROS2, integrate ROS2 control for a differential drive, and configure the lifting unit of the robot. This integration not only facilitates advanced simulations but also streamlines the transition between simulation and real-world applications.

## Objectives
- To migrate URDF descriptions to ROS2 for enhanced simulation compatibility.
- To integrate ROS2 control with a differential drive in the Gazebo model.
- To configure the lifting unit of the robot using ROS2 control for more precise operations.

## Tools and Technologies
