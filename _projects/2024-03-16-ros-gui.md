## Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the ability to interact with and control robots in a user-friendly manner is paramount. This project encapsulates the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables even individuals with minimal robotics experience to teleoperate robots and monitor their status effectively. Utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS), C++, and the CVUI library, this project demonstrates the integration of software development skills with advanced robotics applications.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** C++
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** ROS, OpenCV, CVUI
- **Simulation Environment:** Gazebo
- **Version Control:** Git

## Source Code

[GitHub Robot GUI Repository](https://github.com/MiguelSolisSegura/robot_info)


## Objectives

- To develop a GUI that facilitates the teleoperation of mobile base robots and displays relevant robot information.
- To implement additional ROS nodes that interact with the GUI, providing a comprehensive system for robot control and monitoring.

## Process and Development

The project is divided into two main parts, focusing on the backend ROS nodes development and the GUI implementation.

### Backend ROS Nodes Development

- **Initial Setup:** Involved cloning the necessary repositories, setting up the ROS environment, and starting the simulation in Gazebo.
- **Robot Info Node:** A custom ROS node was developed to publish vital information about the robot, including its description, serial number, IP address, and firmware version, using a custom message type.
- **Distance Tracker Service:** This ROS node calculates the distance traveled by the robot based on odometry data and provides this information through a ROS service upon request.

### GUI Node Implementation

**GUI Development:** Utilizing C++ and the CVUI library, a separate ROS package was created for the GUI node. This node subscribes to the `robot_info` topic and interacts with other ROS nodes to display robot status, control teleoperation, and monitor the robot's position and distance traveled.

**Features of the GUI:** 
- Displays robot information updated in real-time.
- Includes teleoperation buttons for controlling the robot's linear and angular velocities.
- Shows the current robot position based on odometry data.
- Features a button to call the `/get_distance` service and display the distance traveled.
- Features a button to call the `/reset_distance` service to reset the tracked distance status.

## Results

The integration of ROS nodes with a custom-built GUI resulted in a comprehensive system allowing for the intuitive teleoperation of robots and real-time monitoring of their status. This system demonstrates the potential of combining software development skills with robotics to create user-friendly interfaces for complex robotic systems.

## Key Insights

- The project's success underscores the versatility of ROS and the effectiveness of integrating different software tools and libraries.
- Future work may explore the addition of more advanced features to the GUI, such as extending CVUI library capabilities.
