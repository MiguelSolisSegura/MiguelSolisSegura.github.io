## Introduction
The project's aim was to develop and implement the kinematic model for the ROSBot XL robot within a simulated environment using Gazebo Sim (Ignition). This involved determining the robot's movement classification, publishing wheel speeds, and transforming these into commands to control the robot's motion effectively, including following a complex figure-eight trajectory.

## Objectives
- To classify the ROSBot XL as holonomic or non-holonomic based on its movement capabilities.
- To develop a kinematic model that accurately represents the robot's real-world movements.
- To implement a sequence of movements in simulation to demonstrate the robot's capabilities, including a figure-eight trajectory.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** C++
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** Eigen, ROS2, Gazebo Sim
- **Development Tools:** Git for version control

## Source Code
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MiguelSolisSegura/checkpoint16)

## Process and Development
The project consisted of several critical phases, starting from the simulation setup to the execution of complex robot movements.

### Kinematic Model Development and Movement Testing
**Movement Classification:** Conducted tests to classify the ROSBot XL as either holonomic or non-holonomic, crucial for defining the appropriate kinematic model.

**Wheel Velocities Publisher:** Developed a C++ node that publishes the wheel speeds for each of the four wheels, enabling the robot to execute predefined movements like moving in different directions and rotating.

**Kinematic Model Implementation:** Created a node that subscribes to wheel speed outputs and transforms them into Twist messages to control the robot's movements in the simulation accurately.

### Advanced Trajectory Control
**Eight Trajectory Implementation:** Developed a C++ package to command the robot to follow a figure-eight trajectory. This involved programming the robot to respond to a series of waypoints, each representing a segment of the trajectory, thereby testing the robot's precision and responsiveness in a simulated environment.

## Results
The project successfully implemented a kinematic model in ROS2, allowing the ROSBot XL to perform complex movements in a simulated environment. The robot demonstrated its ability to move forward, backward, sideways, rotate both clockwise and counter-clockwise, and precisely follow a figure-eight trajectory.

## Key Insights
- The integration of a detailed kinematic model with ROS2 and Gazebo Sim facilitated a deeper understanding of robotic movement control in simulation environments.
- Future projects could explore more complex trajectories and optimize path planning and control strategies.
