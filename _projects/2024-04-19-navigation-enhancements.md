## Introduction
Following the setup of the navigation system in the [previous entry](https://miguelsolissegura.com/project/navigation-system), this project segment focuses on implementing specific task-oriented navigation routes using the Simple Commander API. The primary goal is to enable the RB-1 robot to autonomously navigate a warehouse environment, perform specific tasks such as transporting items, and handle dynamic obstacles using advanced navigation strategies.

## Objectives
- To program the RB-1 robot to perform precise navigational tasks within a warehouse environment.
- To implement obstacle avoidance and dynamic path reconfiguration using a Keepout Mask.
- To enable the RB-1 to interact with objects in its environment, adapting its physical configuration for task-specific requirements.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** ROS 2, Nav2, Simple Commander API
- **Simulation Environment:** Gazebo, RViz2
- **Version Control:** Git

## Source Code
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MiguelSolisSegura/warehouse_project)

## Process and Development
The project extends the foundational navigation setup from the [previous entry](https://miguelsolissegura.com/project/navigation-system) with complex route planning and execution tasks.

### Task Execution via Simple Commander API
**Setup and Initial Navigation:** Configured the robot to start at the initial position, navigate to a predefined loading position, and engage with a physical object (a shelf).
**Obstacle Avoidance:** Integrated a Costmap Filter with a Keepout Mask to navigate around strategically placed cones within the warehouse environment.

### Interaction with Physical Objects
**Object Manipulation:** Programmed the RB-1 to lift and transport the shelf using an elevator mechanism within the robot. Adjusted the robot’s navigation shape in real-time to accommodate the added dimensions of the carried shelf.
**Task Completion and Reset:** Once the task at the shipping position was completed, the robot was programmed to safely unload the shelf and return to its initial position.

## Results
The RB-1 robot successfully demonstrated its capability to autonomously navigate and perform manipulation tasks within a warehouse environment. The integration of the Simple Commander API with the Nav2 system enabled the robot to handle tasks that require precise positioning and interaction with objects.

## Key Insights
- Effective task-specific reconfiguration of the robot’s navigation parameters is crucial for adaptive performance in dynamic environments.
- The project illustrated the potential for ROS 2-based systems to facilitate sophisticated autonomous operations in industrial applications.
- Future enhancements could focus on optimizing these navigation and interaction processes for a broader range of tasks and environments.
