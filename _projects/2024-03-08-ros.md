**Tools and Technologies Used:**
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Gazebo for simulation
- Custom ROS services
- C++ for ROS node development

**Source Code:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MiguelSolisSegura/gazebo-simulation)

**Objective:** Building upon the foundational RB-1 Robotnik robot developed in the past entry, this project introduces a custom ROS service enabling easy robot rotation control. Targeting users with minimal robotics programming experience, this functionality allows the robot to rotate by a specified number of degrees, enhancing its interactivity and usability.

**Process and Development:**

***ROS Node Creation:*** Initiated by setting up a new ROS package named `my_rb1_ros` within the `catkin_ws`. A C++ script, `rotate_service.cpp`, was developed to implement a ROS node offering the `/rotate_robot` service. This service accepts a request to rotate the robot by a user-defined number of degrees and outputs a success message upon completion.

***Custom Service Message:*** Defined a custom ROS service message, `Rotate.srv`, which includes:
- A request field (`degrees`) to specify the rotation amount.
- A response field (`result`) indicating the operation's success.

***Odometry Utilization:*** The service leverages Odometry data from the `/odom` topic to accurately calculate the robot's rotation, ensuring precise movement control.

**Results and Outcomes:** Successfully implemented and integrated a user-friendly ROS service that enables precise rotational control of the RB-1 Robotnik in the Gazebo simulation environment. The service simplifies robot operation for inexperienced users, fostering greater accessibility and engagement with robotics.

**Key Learnings:**
- The importance of custom ROS services in enhancing robot control and user interaction.
- Effective use of Odometry data to accurately control robot movements.
