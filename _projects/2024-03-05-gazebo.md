**Tools and Technologies Used:** 
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Gazebo Classic for simulation
- RViz for links visualization
- Autodesk Fusion for part schematics

**Source Code:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MiguelSolisSegura/gazebo-simulation)

**Objective:** The goal of this project is to develop from scratch a simplified version of the RB-1 Robotnik robot. The robot should be capable of performing navigation in a Gazebo simulation. Also, the robot should be equipped with Lidar data for obstacle avoidance and to map its surroundings.

**Process and Development:**

***Robot Definition:*** The project began by defining the robot links using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). The robot was modeled using the links distribution shown below.

After the definition, an inspection of the links was performed using Rviz.

***Gazebo Implementation:*** The robot was spawned into a previously built Gazebo world using the ROS Gazebo package. Since the robot possesses two friction wheels, the differential drive plugin was used to enable motion.

***Lidar Integration:*** Integrated a lidar sensor plugin to the robot model in the simulation to gather data about its surroundings. A representation of the obtained measurements can be seen below.

**Results and Outcomes:** The project successfully resulted in a functional simulation of a simplified RB-1 Robotnik robot capable of navigation within a Gazebo environment. The robot effectively incorporated a Lidar sensor for obstacle avoidance and was able to detect its surroundings accurately. The differential drive system provided smooth and controlled motion, essential for the robot navigation tasks. The visualization tools (RViz and Gazebo) proved invaluable for debugging and refining the robot's design and behavior.

**Key Learnings:**
- A good practice to avoid undesired motion when spawning a robot, is to define a small offset in the *Z* axis.
- Gazebo attempts to automatically merge fixed joints. To avoid this, it is necessary not only to set the corresponding tag in the URDF file but also to set the inertial configuration in the independent links.
