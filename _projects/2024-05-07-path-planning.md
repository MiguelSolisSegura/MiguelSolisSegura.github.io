## Introduction
Mobile robot path planning is a foundational skill in robotics, enabling robots to navigate environments autonomously and efficiently. This project served as an exercise in implementing Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm from scratch using ROS2 and Nav2. By swapping out Nav2's default planner for a custom Dijkstra implementation, this project demonstrates how a widely recognized pathfinding algorithm can be used in a factory floor simulation to facilitate autonomous navigation.
